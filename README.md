# webgames

Browser board games, built like an enterprise webapp. Will be available at [games.levilutz.com](https://games.levilutz.com).


## Purpose

To have fun building stuff from the ground up and to keep myself practiced in various industry-relevant technologies.


## Repository Overview

While this repository is a monolith, each directory here is a reasonably independent service / microservice / package. For details, see each directory's `README.md`.

These services should have a few things in common:
* Built to OCI images with either Docker or Buildah
* Deployable to a Kubernetes cluster
* Packaged with Helm
* CI/CD managed with Garden
* For consistency, attaches ingress to `https://<domain>/<game name>` and/or `https://<domain>/api/<game name>`
    * APIs that don't expose on prod can expose on `https://<domain>/dev/<service name>` in development environments for developer convenience. These ingresses should _definitely_ be disabled in prod environments, and services should never route to these URLs.

Besides that, each of these is services is meant to be an independent playground for varying languages, technologies, and design patterns.

Ideally, general and deployment-specific code should be partitioned enough that it's easy to deploy each service on an arbitrary cluster / cloud provider / domain without significant work. Garden has many features which can easily enable movement towards this goal.


## TODO

### More certain plans

* Build out user api for a consistent user experience
* Build chess app with React, REST, Python, PostgresQL stack
* Add a homepage to direct users to various games
    * More full featured? (user profile stuff, centralized leaderboards, idk)


### Things I plan to use here but haven't yet

Backend Languages / Frameworks / Libraries
* FastAPI
* Flask
* Golang
* Python
* Rust
* NodeJs

Frontend Languages / Frameworks / Libraries
* Angular
* Raw JS frontend (maybe a simpler game)
* React
* TypeScript
* Vue

Database technologies
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* PostgresQL

APIs:
* REST (for slower turn-based games)
* GraphQL (for slower complicated games)
* WebSockets (for faster real-time games)
