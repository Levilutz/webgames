# cluster-init scripts

This is just a place to pile up any scripts to initialize a kubernetes cluster to our application's expectations.


## Contents

As of right now, this folder only enumerates one dependency:
* [external-dns](setup-external-dns.sh) - Set up external-dns in the cluster. See code comments for usage instructions.
